# Last_Mile_Delivery_Analysis_and_Prediction
## Summary
This project analyzes last-mile delivery data to identify inefficiencies and predict the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) using regression models. The dataset includes delivery records with timestamps, agent info, and location coordinates. The goal is to build an accurate ETA prediction model and extract insights for logistics optimization.
